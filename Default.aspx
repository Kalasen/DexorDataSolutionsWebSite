                NuGet is a free Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects. 
                NOTE: NuGet is basically just a repository of libraries, which at the same time makes it easier than downloading them from the internet and hooking one up,
                and harder when something breaks.
